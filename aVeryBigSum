Challenge:
In this challenge, you are required to calculate and print the sum of the elements in an array, keeping in mind that some of those integers may be quite large.

Solution:

function aVeryBigSum($ar) {
    
    $sum = 0;
    
    foreach ($ar as $value)
      {
        $sum += $value;
      }

    return $sum;

}
